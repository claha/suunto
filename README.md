# suunto
Python library that generates code for your Suunto, inspired by https://github.com/follesoe/suunto-ambit-intervals. With this library you don't have to press the "Lap" button to continue to the next step in your workout. If this is a feature that you would like please check out the other library, it's awesome.

## Status
Currently only supports time based steps, next distance based will be added. Adding a target pace for each step (optionally) is also planned. In time it will also be possible to define your workout in a .xml/.json/.yaml or something similar.

## How To
See example.py for how to generate the code. Create a new app at movescount. Enable advanced editing and paste the generated code. Define two own variables, STEP and TIMEELAPSED. Save it and add it to a sport mode.
